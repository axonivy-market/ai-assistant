Engage in a more interactive and intuitive workflow by conversing with the assistant about your processes instead of merely executing them. This dynamic interaction enhances your experience, allowing you to explore options and gain insights as you work. With multilingual capabilities, the AI Assistant communicates effortlessly in English, German, Spanish, and more, ensuring you receive support in your preferred language.
